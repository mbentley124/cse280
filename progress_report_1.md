# Progress Report 1

## Summary of Work Completed

### Goals completed this week

We narrowed down the projects our group was interested in to the Concurrent Persistent STL for C++, Uber for Tools, or Learning AI with the Unity Game Engine projects.  

Setup a github repository (https://github.com/mbentley124/cse280)

### Goals not met this week

We have yet to decide on a specific project to work on. 

### Challenges faced this week

Balancing what everyone is looking for in a project. 

### Goals for next week

To determine our project. 

## Individual Member Contributions

For each group member, list the individual contributions, and a link to proof in the form of a commit to your group repository. At the end, provide an estimate for how many hours these contributions took to complete.
