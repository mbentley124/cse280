Dijstra’s, starting at the 2 ends.

“The main idea is to do preprocessing on the graph once, to speed up all following queries. With this additional information itineraries can be computed very fast. Still, Dijkstra's Algorithm is the basis for all optimisations.”
Maybe I can do preprocessing of major routes?
(Do I do that already?)

Multiple ideas on different implementations. Look into further

## https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapidly-exploring_random_tree
A tree that is formed from nodes being randomly explored. This sounds like something that would work best pre-processed, but I could try both.
