# CSE280 Final Report

## Overview
The goal of this project is to integrate the bus tracking system of Lehigh University and LANTA into a single, user friendly system. Additionally, we plan on pursuing a way to link the two systems together and provide a seamless way for students/faculty/staff to transition from one system to another.

## Accomplishments:
- Display map (with light and dark mode options)
- Show Lehigh and LANTA bus stops
- Show Lehigh and LANTA live bus locations
- Designed, created, and installed database for storing bus & stop locations
- Scraped data now auto-uploaded to database
- Designed and implemented algorithm to determine bus routes 

## Future Goals:
- Transition to a Java backend
- Add functionality: Allow users to highlight individual routes
- Add functionality: Find closest stop
- Add functionality: Give directions using Lehigh & LANTA services
- Smooth out bus animations (so they arenâ€™t jumpy when the locations update)
- Improve UI

## Technology Used:
- Python script for web scraping from Lehigh & LANTA bus websites
- MapBox, Leaflet, Javascript for displaying map
- PureCSS for User Interface styling
- SQL database
- Javaspark backend
- scraped data is put in JSON files (which are then put in database)

Throughout the semester I split my time working through problems with teammates and tackling other aspects of the app on my own. Specifically, I spent time designing the front-end (mostly HTML & CSS, with some Javascript), with friendliness to the end user in mind. Otherwise, I was often on the phone figuring out ways to optimize the 'flow of data', which includes: how users connect to our application remotely and are served up the map, bus, and stop locations; how we formulate the routes based on the information we pull from Lehigh and LANTA websites; how the data we pull is stored. That involved working between various technologies including Java, SQL, and JSON.

Most of this semester was spent setting up the backend for the website to use. Currently the website uses the backend directly from lehigh and lanta. The backend, which I am currently in the process of creating, will replace this. It is setup using Maven, with all the depency's managed within that. These depencies include jdbc, which is used to make the database queries, and spark, which is used to manage the backend routes (both of which were used in CSE 216). There is an intial route setup on the backend which retreives the routes that a bus travels. There is a minor issue with the campus connector route since sometimes stops are missing from the data (should be able to fix it once buses are back up and running). The specifics of the route determination code was written by Cody and Joe. 

In order to run the code on one's own machine there is a script called ssh_forwarding.sh. This forwards the proper port to the database so that jdbc is able to connect to the mysql database properly. This script should not be required for running backend on the server, but only on your personal device. In terms of future plans there are list of backend routes (in the team drive) which are planned to be setup. There are some routes in that list which are stretch goals (i.e. route highlighting file). In the future in addition to setting up these planned routes the backend needs to be integrated with the frontend and the backend needs to be setup on the server.

Overall this semester I spent a lot of time on getting our tileservers and doing a lot of behind the scenes devops work. Despite taking a bit of time, it was a great learning experience to stand everything up from nothing. Currently, we have a few VCLs to handle expiring tiles, along with handling some relatively static routes. 

Outside of dev ops work, I spent the rest of my time optimizing the front end. This proved to be a pretty big challenge, since we have roughly ~1000 stops/buses on the map at a time. To remedy this, I moved to using Canvas markers on the map, which are much more efficient in rendering. Additionally, I fixed a nasty memory bug which would cause the map to lock up and freeze after about an hour. Outside of optimization, I was able to include a much requested feature from people -- the ability to find the nearest bus stop based on your location. Moving forward, I intend to make use of JS workers to handle any location/distance calculations.
